# Kays Modern Appartments — Demo

This is a single-file demo HTML page for advertising apartment listings for **Kays Modern Appartments**. Prices are shown in Zambian Kwacha (K).

How to use
- Open `apartment-ad.html` in your browser (double-click or use PowerShell):

```powershell
Start-Process .\workspace\apartment-ad.html
```

- Replace sample images (Unsplash links) with your own photos.
- Update listing text, prices (use `K` for Kwacha), and contact email inside the HTML.
- For production, replace the mailto behavior with a server endpoint to capture leads.

Notes
- The page is a simple static template: responsive CSS, client-side search, and a contact modal that opens a mailto link for demonstration.
